<h1>Random Compounds Description</h1>
<p>Click <a href = "randomCompounds.html">here</a> to go back to the random compound generator.</p>
<p>This is a site I made so that people can practice naming compounds and get feedback.  It supports normal, binary compounds, compounds with complex ions, and complicated compounds (more than just two types of ions together).  The site has options for people to practice naming compounds in flashcard style on the website, make a worksheet of potentially billions of problems, or use the practice assesment function on the website.</p>
<p>To ensure I got the naming scheme correct for compounds with complex ions or multiple cations/anions, I consulted the <a href="https://old.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf">IUPAC red book</a> that is released online.  I found pages 70-80 especially useful.</p>

<p>Possible FAQs</p>
<p>Q: How do the percentages work for the complex and complicated compounds?</p>
<p>A: The percent complicated option refers to the chance that the compound will have more than two ions.  However, the percent complex option represents the chance that every ion has to be a complex ion.  This is unless a compound like Manganese(II,III) is created, in which the cation of the compound will always be a transition metal.</p>
<p>Q: Why can the generator not create compounds that are hydrates?</p>
<p>A: Sorry.  I just don't understand how to get the maximum waters of hydration that can be on a compound, since they seem very sporadic.</p>
<p>Q: Why is Na₂HPO₄ considered to be disodium hydrogen phosphate and not sodium monohydrogen phosphate?</p>
<p>A: Check page 75 of the IUPAC red book.  According to them, compounds with more than two ions need to give a prefix to every ion that has a quantity of more than one.</p>
<p>Q: Why did you use pure javascript rather than a framework like vuejs?</p>
<p>A: This website was made in mind that people could just download the site off of github and run it on their computer/phone without any issue.  I knew that purejs would work, so I decided to use that.</p>
