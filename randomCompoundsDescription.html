<p>This is a site I made so that people can practice naming compounds and get feedback.  It supports normal, binary compounds, compounds with complex ions, and complicated compounds (more than just two types of ions together).  The site has options for people to practice naming compounds in flashcard style on the website, make a worksheet of potentially billions of problems, or use the practice assesment function on the website.</p>
<p>To ensure I got the naming scheme correct for compounds with complex ions or multiple cations/anions, I consulted the <a href="https://old.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf">IUPAC red book</a> that is released online.  I found pages 70-80 especially useful.</p>
