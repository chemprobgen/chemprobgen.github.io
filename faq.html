<h1>Possible FAQs</h1>

<p><b>Questions about the site in general</b></p>
<p>Q: Why did you use pure javascript rather than a framework like vuejs?</p>
<p>A: This website was made in mind that people could just download the site off of github and run it on their computer/phone without any issue.  It was also meant to function perfectly if the user ever lost internet connection.  I knew that purejs would work, so I decided to use that.</p>

<p><b>Compound Generator Questions</b></p>
<p>Q: How does the percentage work for covalent compounds?</p>
<p>A: The probability represents the likelihood of getting a covalent compound.  If a compound becomes covalent, it will have 0% chance of being complex, regardless of what the complex option is set to.</p>
<p>Q: How do the percentages work for the complex and complicated compounds?</p>
<p>A: The percent complicated option refers to the chance that the compound will have more than two ions.  However, the percent complex option represents the chance that every ion in an ionic compound has to be a complex ion.</p>
<p>Q: Why can the generator not create compounds that are hydrates?</p>
<p>A: Sorry.  I just don't understand how to get the number of waters of hydration that can be on a compound, since they seem very sporadic.</p>
<p>Q: Why is Na₂HPO₄ considered to be disodium hydrogen phosphate and not sodium monohydrogen phosphate?</p>
<p>A: Check page 75 of the IUPAC red book.  According to them, compounds with more than two ions need to give a prefix to every ion that has a quantity of more than one.</p>
